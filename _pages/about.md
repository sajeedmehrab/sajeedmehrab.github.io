I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. My research is in multimodal knowledge-guided machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in problems that require integrating knowledge into machine learning models for robust and explainable predictions. This knowledge could be available as various forms of scientific data, including images, graphs or text. Currently, I am working on fine-grained visual problems. 

I am advised by [Prof. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/) at the [KGML lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/). I am also closely associated with the [NSF HDR Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.osu.edu/).

When I'm not working, I love to bike, run or workout. 

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
