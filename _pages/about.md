I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. My research is in multimodal knowledge-guided machine learning. Specifically, I am interested in problems that require integrating knowledge into machine learning models for robust and explainable predictions. This knowledge could be available as various forms of scientific data, including images, graphs or text. Currently, I am working on fine-grained visual problems. 

I am advised by [Prof. Anuj Karpatne](https://people.cs.vt.edu/karpatne/) at the [KGML lab](https://kgml-lab.github.io/). I am also closely associated with the [NSF HDR Imageomics Institute](https://imageomics.osu.edu/).

When I'm not working, I love to bike, run, workout or cook!
